Linux Administration, Containerization, Automation and Scripting Workshop
==========================================================================

The workshop will give the participants a comprehensive understanding of Linux systems, equipping them with the skills to manage and maintain linux-based environments effectively. It will cover creating and managing users and file systems, monitoring and executing software installation and package management, introducing new containerization technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes, and learning scripting techniques for automating linux tasks.
The labs cover user and group maintenance, software management, administration task automation, file system creation and maintenance, remote access management, working with cron, configuring basic file sharing and Web services, using system logging utilities, learning the fundamentals of containerization, and writing efficient scripts to reduce manual work and improve system reliability.
The workshop is designed for network engineers and system administrators who want to strengthen their linux administration skills and develop their technical knowledge.
